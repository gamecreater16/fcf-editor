<====V1.5(14/03/2015)====> *PUBLIC(STABLE)*
+ Added a Changelog window in the About window! It auto-reads data, stored in Changelog.txt(this file) and creates a collapsible panel for each version!
+ Added FSN and some of FHA variables data internally, if the variables.txt file isn't specified or missing...
+ Re-designed the About screen again!
+ Disallowed exiting when you've made some changes in the flowchart... Finally, a good feature!
+ Ctrl+Shift+S can be used to 'Save As' flowchart data!
+ Default comment, "COMMENT!", is used when saving, instead of leaving blank lines!
+ Disallowed entry of ':' and '//' for SELECTERs' alternative text in FHA format, since FHA uses ':' for flag-operations for SELECTERs...
+ Added the ability to change flag names for SCENEs' jumps and flag operations by typing, as well as selecting from the list... This means NO LIMITATIONS! Do it whatever way you wish! But, remember that '(' is used to differentiate between the flag name and remark!
+ Now, you can't just back out of updating! Press 'Update' button to do other things!
+ If you don't want to update, then there's another option: 'RESET!' button to reset the data...
- A lot of funny bugs are crushed now!

<====V1.2.2(11/03/2015)====> *PUBLIC(STABLE)*
+ Confirm dialog box is displayed now when deleting the flow elements!
+ Dragging now updates ONLY the position fields in the text box on the right!
~ KNOWN BUG: Even if the 'Update' button isn't pressed, the flow element data is changed... Need a way to inherit from a class object...
~ KNOWN BUG: If the window has to be scrolled to view the flow elements, then their positioning isn't correct... Needs a way to check the flow element's actual position, not the relative position...

+ Re-structured and cleaned the code...
+ Animated the About screen... Just a subtle fade-in effect...
+ Allowed only the entry of numbers in textboxes, which should contain numbers, like ID, X and Y...
+ Added some funny warnings and error statements, using MessageBox...
- Disallowed the entry of '(single quote) in the title box, since it's used by the engine to split the lines...
- Fixed a LOT of crazy bugs and leaks...
+ KNOWN BUG: When selecting any SELECTER (with more than one alternative), it replaces the Choice text for the first alternative with the Choice text for the last alternative.
+ KNOWN BUG: When selecting any SCENE (with more than one Flag Check or Operation), it replaces the operation/check value for the first tab with the same of the last tab.

<====V0.8(15/02/2015)====> *PUBLIC(BETA)*
+ Added SCENEs (90%) <- It was completely done, but I realised that in Flag Checks, Link Type isn't used, so you can't jump to a scene, depending on more than one flags...

+ Added a feature to browse to a folder containing all the .fcf files and set it as a root folder for future operations (currently used in OUTERLABELs only...)(90%)
